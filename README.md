# Biclustering of big RNA sequecing data.

## Intro

## Application

We apply several biblustering algorthms directly on the RNA-seq or on the Ribo-Seq data, as welll as on the translation efficiency matrix and tried to identify common patterns of tranlation and/or translation efficiency.

### Biclustering algorithms.

The following algorithms were used (code on the jupyter file)

### Bicluster evaluation.

The measures described on "ref." and implemented on the R script that calculates all measures for each bicluster. 

## Discussion

### Results.

Results are all collected in a form of Jupyter notebook in the 'results' forlder.
